# 100 days of code - Creating my personal Harry Potter universe

This repository contains all the code I produced and will produce during my '100 days of code challenge'. As outlined in [my blog post](http://www.alpopkes.com/posts/2018/07/blog-post-1), I decided to take on a new habit using a technique I found on the ['get discplined' subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1x99m6/im_a_piece_of_shit_no_more_games_no_more_lies_no/cf9dz72/).

As one of my new habits I chose: "Code for 15 minutes every day". And since I have always wanted to participate in the [100 days of code challenge](https://pybit.es/special-100days.html) I will combine the new habit with the challenge.

A logbook of what I worked on each day can be found on my [website](http://www.alpopkes.com/posts/2018/07/).
